        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Revanth, a second-year student with a sweet tooth for many sweets and icecreams and a passion for web development. I like to suffer... i mean enjoy exploring the world of coding and technology, and I aspire to become a skilled web developer in the future. Whether it's building websites or learning new programming languages like py and java, I am a bit of a procrastinator myself but i get the things done before deadline just like this project </p>
